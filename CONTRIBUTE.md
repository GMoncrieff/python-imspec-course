There are two main ways to contribute to this GitHub.  
- **Suggest a change, addition, or deletion to what is already on the GitHub using [Issues](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/issues).** 
     - Before submitting a new issue, check to make sure a similar issue isn't already open. If one is, contribute to that issue thread with your feedback.
     - When submitting a bug report, please try to provide as much detail as possible, i.e. a screenshot or [gist](https://gist.github.com/) that demonstrates the problem, the technology you are using, and any relevant links.

     - by translating content to a new language
     - by writing or editing documentation
     - by writing specifications

In the spirit of open source software, everyone is encouraged to help improve this project!
                                                               
## New to GitHub? Start here!
You can [sign up for GitHub here](https://github.com/)! The NASA Transform to Open Science Team has made a short video demonstrating how to make an easy pull request [here](https://youtu.be/PHoScPeMWHI).

For a more in-depth start, we suggest *[Getting Started with Git and GitHub: The Complete Beginnerâ€™s Guide](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-git-and-github-6fcd0f2d4ac6)* and *[The Beginners Guide to Git and GitHub](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-beginners-guide-to-git-github/)*. We've summarized some of the most important points below.

Once you've identified something you'd like to help with you're ready to make a change to the project repository!

1. First, describe what you're planning to do as a comment to the issue, (and this might mean making a new issue).

    [This blog](https://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/) is a nice explanation of why putting this work in up front is so useful to everyone involved.

2. Fork this repository to your profile.

    You can now do whatever you want with this copy of the project. You won't mess up anyone else's work so you're super safe.

    Make sure to [keep your fork up to date]( https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/wiki/Syncing-your-fork-to-the-original-repository-via-the-browser) with the master repository.

3. Make the changes you've discussed.

    Try to keep the changes focused rather than changing lots of things at once. If you feel tempted to branch out then please *literally* branch out: create separate branches for different updates to make the next step much easier!

4. Submit a pull request.

    A member of the executive team will review your changes, have a bit of discussion and hopefully merge them in!  
    
    N.B. you don't have to be ready to merge to make a pull request! We encourage you to submit a pull request as early as you want to. They help us to keep track of progress and help you to get earlier feedback.

## Development Model

For accepting new contributions, We use the [forking workflow](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/). As the first step of your contribution, you'll want to fork this repository, make a local clone of it, add your contribution, and then create a pull request back to the main repository.  

All documentation should be written using Markdown and Github Markdown-supported HTML.
